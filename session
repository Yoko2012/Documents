// A BaseSession manages general session state. This includes negotiation
// of both the application-level and network-level protocols:  the former
// defines what will be sent and the latter defines how it will be sent.  Each
// network-level protocol is represented by a Transport object.  Each Transport
// participates in the network-level negotiation.  The individual streams of
// packets are represented by TransportChannels.  The application-level protocol
// is represented by SessionDecription objects.
